# Welcome

Magico is a C# library that allows you to pull some magical tricks on a variety of things, such as `IEnumerable` instances and file magic investigation. To use this library, go to any page in the left side of the screen.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Starting from Magico v1.1.1, 32-bit support has been removed. If you still want to target 32-bit platforms in your applications, you can use v1.1.0.1 or older, but you'll miss out on all the new features and the improvements. We advise you to take out 32-bit support as soon as you can.
